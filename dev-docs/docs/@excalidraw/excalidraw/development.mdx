# Development

This page relates to developing the `@drawink/drawink` package itself.

## Example app

To start the example app using the `@drawink/drawink` package, follow the below steps:

1. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the example app

   ```bash
   yarn start:example
   ```

   [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) will open in your default browser.
   
   This is the same example as the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/drawink/drawink/tree/master/examples/with-script-in-browser) example.

## Releasing

### Creating a production release

To release the next stable version follow the below steps:

```bash
yarn release --tag=latest --version=0.19.0
```

You will need to pass the `latest` tag with `version` for which you want to create the release. This will make the changes needed before publishing the packages into NPM, like updating dependencies of all `@drawink/*` packages, generating new entries in `CHANGELOG.md` and more.
