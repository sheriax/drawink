## Usage

Once the library is installed, its ready to use.

```js
import { parseMermaidToDrawink } from "@drawink/mermaid-to-drawink";
import { convertToDrawinkElements}  from "@drawink/drawink"

try {
  const { elements, files } = await parseMermaid(diagramDefinition, {
    fontSize: DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE,
  });
  // currently the elements returned from the parser are in a "skeleton" format
  // which we need to convert to fully qualified drawink elements first
  const drawinkElements = convertToDrawinkElements(elements);

  // Render elements and files on Drawink
} catch (e) {
  // Error handling
}
```
