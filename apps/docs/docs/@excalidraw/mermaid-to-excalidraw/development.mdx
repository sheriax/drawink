# Development

This page relates to developing the `@drawink/mermaid-to-drawink` package itself.

## Setting up in Local

To set up the library in local, follow the below steps 👇🏼

### Clone the Repository

Go to [@drawink/mermaid-to-drawink](https://github.com/drawink/mermaid-to-drawink) and clone the repository to your local.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:drawink/mermaid-to-drawink.git
```

### Install the dependencies

Using `npm`

```

### Run the playground server

```bash

```

This will start the playground server in port `1234` and you start playing with the playground.

## Creating a test release

We will soon simplify creating release via commenting on GitHub PR similar till then you can create a release by following the below steps

1. Create the build

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create the dist folder which we need to publish next.

2. Publish the library

Update the package name and version in [package.json](https://github.com/drawink/mermaid-to-drawink/blob/master/package.json) and run the below command to publish it

```bash
yarn publish
```

And thats all your test release is successfully created 🎉
